# Coding-Challenge-4
This is a repository for Coding-Challenge-4 for the ISM3232 Class where we will create an Inventory Management System.
In this challenge, we will create a system that can display product details and stock status, check items that are low in stock, update stock per number of units sold and process a sale while updating the inventory. 
This challenge uses an array of objects, functions, control structures, ternary operators, and other such basic JavaScript concepts.
